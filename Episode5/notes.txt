1. Export & Import in JavaScript

-> Default Export (export default)

Only one default export per file.
Imported without curly braces ({}).
Import name can be different from the exported name.

-> Named Export (export)

Can export multiple values from a module.
Must use curly braces ({}) when importing.

-> #useState Hook (State Management)
useState is a React Hook for managing state in functional components.
State updates trigger re-renders.
Batching: Multiple state updates inside event handlers are combined.

-> 3. React Fiber (New Reconciliation Algorithm)
Introduced in React 16 for better UI rendering.
Key Features:
Interruptible Rendering: Can pause and resume rendering.
Priority Scheduling: UI updates are prioritized.
Concurrency: Handles multiple tasks efficiently.
Error Recovery: Can recover from UI errors without crashing the whole app.

4. Virtual DOM (VDOM)
Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the Real DOM.
React compares Virtual DOM versions to update the UI efficiently.
Why not update the real DOM directly?
Direct DOM updates are slow and trigger multiple reflows.
Virtual DOM minimizes updates by calculating only the necessary changes.

5. Diff Algorithm (Efficient DOM Updates)
React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous Virtual DOM.

Key Optimizations:
Element Type Comparison:
If same type, React updates only attributes.
If different type, React unmounts and mounts a new element.

Keys in Lists:
key helps React identify list items efficiently.
Bad: key={index} (causes unnecessary re-renders).
Good: key={uniqueId}.

6. Reconciliation (Efficient UI Updates)
Reconciliation is Reactâ€™s process of updating the UI efficiently.
Steps:
New Virtual DOM is created.
React compares (diffs) the new Virtual DOM with the old one.
React finds the minimal updates.
Updates only the necessary elements in the Real DOM.

7. Why React is Fast?
Virtual DOM: Prevents unnecessary real DOM updates.
Fiber Architecture: Uses concurrent rendering for smooth UI.
Efficient Reconciliation: Uses the diff algorithm to update only changed elements.
Batching Updates: Groups multiple state updates to avoid extra renders.
Concurrent Mode (Newer Feature): Allows React to pause and resume rendering for performance optimization.
