- #JSX (JavaScript XML) => JSX must return only ONE root element.

JSX is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
It gets transpiled into React.createElement calls using Babel (a JavaScript compiler).
Attributes in JSX use camelCase (className, onClick instead of class, onclick).
This is syntactic sugar for React.createElement.

ðŸ”¥ Transpilation Process: Babel transpiles JSX into plain JavaScript that browsers understand.

JSX â†’ Babel converts it into React.createElement.
React.createElement â†’ Creates a JavaScript object representation of the element.
JavaScript object â†’ React renders it into an actual DOM element.

- #Functional Components (Modern React)
Functional components are JavaScript functions that return JSX.
They start with a capital letter by convention.
because how JSX is transpiled and how browsers handle HTML elements
- it should must return JSX

- #Component Composition => is the process of nesting one component inside another
