React First Class - Short Notes 📝
1️⃣ React CDN – Used React via CDN without installing npm.

Included React and ReactDOM using <script> tags.
2️⃣ React.createElement() – Creates elements instead of writing HTML.


const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World from React");
1st argument: Tag name ("h1")
2nd argument: Attributes ({})
3rd argument: Content ("Hello World from React")

3️⃣ Rendering in React – Uses root.render() to show elements on the page.


const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(heading);
Converts React object into an actual HTML element and displays it.

4️⃣ Nested Elements in React

Multiple elements inside React.createElement() use an array [].

const parent = React.createElement("div", { id: "parent" }, [
    React.createElement("div", { id: "child" }, [
        React.createElement("h1", {}, "I am h1 tag"),
        React.createElement("h2", {}, "I am h2 tag")
    ])
]);
root.render(parent);
Creates a nested structure dynamically.

5️⃣ React Element → Object → HTML

React elements are JavaScript objects, converted into HTML by ReactDOM.
6️⃣ Next Class: JSX

JSX makes writing React easier (e.g., <h1>Hello JSX</h1> instead of React.createElement()).
Key Takeaways ✅
✔ React uses React.createElement() instead of plain HTML.
✔ ReactDOM renders React elements into the browser.
✔ Nested elements are passed as an array.
✔ React elements are objects before being converted to HTML.
