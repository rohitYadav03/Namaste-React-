1. Is JSX mandatory for React?
No, but it makes coding easier by allowing HTML & JavaScript together.
Without JSX, you need React.createElement(), which is complex.

2. Is ES6 mandatory for React?
No, but recommended.
ES6+ makes React code cleaner and better (e.g., let/const, arrow functions, classes).

3. {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}
{TitleComponent} â†’ Refers to a JavaScript variable/function.
{<TitleComponent/>} â†’ Renders a React component.
{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} â†’ Used when adding child components inside.

4. How to write comments in JSX?
Use {/* comment */} inside JSX.

5. What is <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></>?
  Wrap multiple elements without extra <div> tags.
<></> is a shorter version of <React.Fragment>

6. Why do we need keys in React?
Keys help React identify list items & update only changed ones.

7. Can we use index as a key in React?
Yes, but not recommended (may cause UI bugs if items change order).
Use unique IDs instead.

8. What are props in React?
Props (properties) pass data from parent to child components.

9.  What is Config Driven UI?
UI changes based on config files (JSON) instead of hardcoded values.
Useful for dynamic & scalable apps.

10. Virtual DOM vs Real DOM
Feature	 Virtual DOM	      |  Real DOM
Speed	 Fast	              | Slow
Updates	 Only updates changes |	Updates everything
Memory	 Efficient	          |  Wastes memory
React uses Virtual DOM â†’ Updates only changed elements â†’ Faster UI! ðŸš€
